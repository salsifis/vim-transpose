Welcome to the transpose plugin tutorial.

For your convenience, tab characters appear as > throughout this tutorial,
except if you don't have `:set modeline` in your vimrc.

First, ensure that |g:transpose_keepindent| is equal to 1. This should be the
case if you did not mess with the plugin settings.

===============================================================================
Basic transposition~
                                                         *:Transpose*

Visually select the following lines (V2j) and use the |:Transpose| command
(you will see :'<,'>Transpose in the command bar)
Then, Use :Transpose another time on the result.
>
    abcd
    efghij
    klmno
<
As you see, the :Transpose command takes an array of characters, and swaps
lines with columns. When you run :Transpose a second time, you will get the
original text back, except that extra spaces will have been inserted, which
is because :Transpose needs to work on rectangular data

===============================================================================
Word transposition~
                                                         *:TransposeWords*

Visually select the following lines (V3j) and use the |:TransposeWords|
command.
Then, Use :TransposeWords another time on the result.
>
    Eeny  meenie miny    moe
    Catch a      tiger   by  the toe
    If    he     hollers let him go
    Eeny  meenie miny    moe
<
You can see that this command will insert interrogation marks when an input
line was not long enough and there is a missing field. If it did not, the
command would not be invertible.

However you can provide an additional argument to :TransposeWords to set that
default value and override the interrogation mark.

===============================================================================
Tab-separated fields transposition~
                                                         *:TransposeTab*

Visually select the following lines (V3j) and use the |:TransposeTab| command.
Then, Use :TransposeTab another time on the result.
>
    Eeny	meenie	miny	moe
    Catch	a	tiger	by	the	toe
    If	he	hollers	let	him	go
    Eeny	meenie	miny	moe
<
This is similar to :TransposeWords, but any tabulation is a separator.
Multiple tabs are considered as many separators. Therefore, there is no need
for a default value.

===============================================================================
Separated fields transposition~
                                                         *:TransposeCSV*

Visually select the following lines (V2j) and use the |:TransposeCSV| command.
Then, Use :TransposeCSV another time on the result.
>
    ab;cd
    e;f;gh;ij
    klm;no
<
This is like the tab-separated case, but the separator is by default the
semicolon. However you can specify the separator of your choice in a first
argument. You can Use :TransposeCSV \	 instead of :TransposeTab but as you
can see it is necessary to escape the tabulation character, which is messy.

Visually select the following lines (V2j) and type >
 :TransposeCSV ,
<and another time to switch back:
>
    ab,cd
    e,f,gh,ij
    klm,no
<
You can also provide a second argument, which is the delimiter. In this case:
 - A field will be delimited when the first character in the field is the
   delimiter.
 - When a field is delimited, it must end with the delimiter
 - When a field is delimited, it can include the separator
 - When a field is delimited, it can include the delimiter, escaped by itself
   (like SQL string literals).

Try to transpose this CSV separated by tab and delimited by apostrophe: you
will have to escape the tab with a backslash in the command line.
:TransposeCSV \	 '
>
    'I''m a field	 with a tab'	I'm a field without tab
    No tab here	'There is a tab	here'	A third field
<
===============================================================================
Interactive transposition~
                                                         *:TransposeInteractive*

Assume this input
>
    A		b	c
    D	e		f
    	ghi
<
You want this output:
>
    A,D,
    b,e,ghi
    c,f,xxx
<
It is possible! Basically, your input fields are separated by one or more
tabs, you want to have a table with commas in the output, and nonexistent
fields (the third input line had only two fields) will come as xxx

Select the input lines and use |:TransposeInteractive|, you will be prompted
for:
 - A vim pattern that will be used to separate input fields: type >

       \t\+
<
 - An output separator, type a comma
 - A default field value, type xxx 

That's all.
